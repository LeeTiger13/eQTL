To delve into the genetic basis of complex traits in crops and their evolutionary mechanisms, a genetic analysis platform based on high-throughput transcriptomics has been constructed. 

This platform combines RNA sequencing with expression quantitative trait loci (eQTL) analysis to reveal the relationship between gene expression regulatory networks and important agronomic traits. 

Through large-scale transcriptome analysis, it systematically studies changes in gene expression, identifies genetic regulatory loci, and mines candidate causal genes. Below is the visualization of some results:
